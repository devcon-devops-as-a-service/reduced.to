## How to Contribute ü§î

To get started, look at the existing [**Issues**](https://github.com/rupali-codes/LinksHub/issues) or [**create a new issue**](https://github.com/rupali-codes/LinksHub/issues/new/choose)!

### Setup guidelines ü™ú
Follow these steps to setup LinksHub on your local machine

1. [Fork](https://github.com/rupali-codes/LinksHub/fork) the project
2. Clone the project to run on your local machine using the following command:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/reduced.to.git
   ```

3. Get into the root directory

   ```sh
   cd reduced.to
   ```

4. Install all dependencies by running

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

5. Create your branch

   ```sh
   git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
   ```
   
6. Copy `.example.env` to `.env` and fill it properly.

7. Make sure you have a local instance of PostgreSQL running on port 5432. If not, you can run it using docker:
   ```sh
   docker run --name reduced_to_db -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=reduced_to_db -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
   ```
8. Run Prisma migration from root folder:
   ```sh
   npx nx migrate-dev prisma --name=init
   ```
9. Run the backend from root folder:
   ```sh
   npx nx serve backend
   ```
10. Run the frontend from root folder:
    ```sh 
    npx nx serve frontend
    ```
   
### üê≥ Docker

You can build the docker images by running the following nx command:

  ```sh
npx nx run-many -t docker-build
  ```

- This command will automatically build the dependencies and the backend and frontend images.

### üêô Docker compose

- In case you have docker installed, you can _single-click_ deploy and test your changes by running the following and going to `http://localhost:5000/` on your browser.
- When you run the command below, don't forget to change the .env file with the correct values.

  ```sh
  docker compose -f docker/local/docker-compose.yml -p reduced-to up
  ```

### üë∑ Configuration

For the minimal configuration you can just rename the `.example.env` files to `.env`.
